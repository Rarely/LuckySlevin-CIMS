The first task is to create your own user. On the top of the page you will see a button that looks like this:</p>\r\n<p><img id="docs-internal-guid-c44a3040-663e-1e89-8176-3d0bf26d6fb7" style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5ygkhImev3QhaKeDPIJNPHFtmg3IieDZX61JUmFheVvIlOmyhYNliOElkk6PHS4QJdyYKZrCAEJGKsCACZRGyV-ROeLU7XufXKJKLkbdDuCnMbuAHDn9X5rUuBlB1V7S_g" alt="management button.png" width="127px;" height="52px;" /><br />Click this button to show the drop-down list.

If you are not redirected to this page, please attempt Step 3 again.<br /><br />&nbsp;<img id="docs-internal-guid-c44a3040-663f-b1c0-25f2-178c7ddf99de" style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o1T2yf2FV8QkJLhh-D_mrEFooJUhJ4OfDOUnbo_moBHgVH3LzetIT0B0S_YkL-ekAW4uLroqb_hg0tIC924xxDNrpAtKGYtKOJYqi1QP5pYTe86gfMBjlqMix9McuRU7Cw" alt="" width="624px;" height="137px;" /><br /><br />Step 5: <br />It is time to create your own user. In the top right corner you should see an icon that looks like a person with a plus symbol, similar to this <img id="docs-internal-guid-c44a3040-663f-d6f8-0f8b-7ef41a9f7af4" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1KkDBSlR3qePRqsUJQm_M46xymDqFbBIeOms3T4_wSr7EX7RZou9nqNIML9aUK9xf-gfaiYsdkch6x5bC__nbjaTNM02ESaf8WtJNhzF6PlHDa1m_MnwyCERt4EIRWb4Cg" alt="add a user.png" width="45px;" height="43px;" />. Please click this button.<br /><br /><br />Step 6: <br />You should now be re-directed to a <strong>Create User</strong> page, just like the image below. You will see 3 fields which you will need to fill in: Name, Email, and Role.</p>\r\n<p><img id="docs-internal-guid-c44a3040-6640-6c02-1c00-4d7043ab2910" style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Bo3pFjUQWOwQXl0KnOjRba2CLvLkOCYdCqvFUfnAufExWJaCDnmKkPOQlNyPtJXZ2xxd8ZPb3C8VpAox5uCbhw9NG8qOvtVrtcWQ50esYarov0xd8ZhmxmBOHc3kzJ1Sg" alt="Create User.png" width="624px;" height="295px;" /><br /><strong>Name</strong>: This will be the display name of the user you are creating. <br /><strong>Email Address</strong>: You will be required to enter a valid email address. It is vital that you use a real email account as an email will be sent to that address with steps to create a password.<br /><strong>Role</strong>: There are 2 roles to select from. Since you are going to be an administrator of the system you need to select the Admin role. Standard user&rsquo;s will not have access to the management tools.<br />Once all 3 fields are filled out, please click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.<br /><br />Step 7: <br />You should now be directed back to the <strong>User Management</strong> page. You should now see 2 users of the system, the admin@cims.com and the account that you created. If you do not see the account you just created, please attempt Steps 4-6 again. If you continue to have problems, please contact your server host.<br /><br />Step 8: <br />Now that you&rsquo;ve create the new user, you want to logout of the admin@cims.com account. To do so, in the top right corner you should see the following button.</p>\r\n<p><img id="docs-internal-guid-c44a3040-6641-0e76-c1e1-e28f294695de" style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ih-834RwqLiZXY6ck7Ullhl4cYP2lxcjTclM7_oIHqdwVX5AakL5p6MVIU_f44cEwjx7jFFQwaOs9o9I2LwKM0Lr_bhlOazYOH_OqX6seu4zL5DGh_pqOJLyjt_DNRV2lw" alt="Logout button.png" width="149px;" height="47px;" /><br />Please click this button and then select Logout. This should now take you back to the login page. <br /><br /><br />Step 9: <br />You should receive an email within a few minutes from no-reply@cims.com. The email should look similar to the one below. Inside this email will be a link. This link will direct you to a new page where you will setup your password for the account you just created. The link will only be valid for a period of 24 hours for security reasons. Please click the link.</p>\r\n<p><img id="docs-internal-guid-c44a3040-6641-633d-35ba-53b4ff381be6" style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X9a3z4XhgKTA-MOKUg6igKi2V81ZhKADioFAUU9g49zs7DEhromUcbWb-jS-2U7CwVca-qN-rlNjsac-zNPHZV5yfwebEkkg7n7nk4wo_Ha6hDNHifHAYfCwvXquIceMLQ" alt="" width="449px;" height="141px;" /><br /><br />Step 10:<br />You should now be at the New Password page that looks like the image below.

Please login with the user you just created (<strong>not</strong> the admin@cims.com account you used earlier). If the setup process worked, you should be logged in and taken to the <strong>Home</strong> page once again.

Activity is defined as an idea being updated or commented on. On each of the small idea views, you will notice there is a colour on the bottom of them. This signifies activity. Ideas with a very bright green will be active ideas. As ideas become more inactive, this colour will change from bright green to a purplish blue, as seen in the image below.</p>\r\n<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9f17b33b-6bec-2549-2443-37c84da4e494" style="font-weight: normal;"><img style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9hDT1hfPH_cTir7WiWyN_hmjZPz211lN1s3USWPb3I2Qj0jEKVvl7NKo-GQxN51uNDJsnHLrG42O32wZSFieqIor2Ain88FA-kOEuOuyH7VFzVgJOa970HfK3IhKIswUdA" alt="" width="624px;" height="184px;" /></strong></p>\r\n<h4>Recently Created Ideas</h4>\r\n<p>This section contains the ideas that were most recently created by members of CCEL.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h4>Community Partner Ideas</h4>\r\n<p>Ideas that were created using the public page (created by community partners) will be displayed in this section in order of most recently added.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h4>Inactive Ideas</h4>\r\n<p>This section is the opposite of active ideas, being the most inactive ideas. These will be ideas with the blue colour at the bottom of them. An idea will be the max blue colour after 30 days of inactivity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><br /><br />3.3 Search</h2>\r\n<p>The Search page allows you to quickly find any idea in the system. There are 3 major functionalities on the Search page: searching, filtering, and sorting. This section gives a brief description of the purpose of each of these functionalities. For a full explanation of <strong>searching</strong>, <strong>filtering</strong>, and <strong>sorting</strong> please refer to <em>Sections 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8</em></p>\r\n<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9f17b33b-6bec-4f76-353d-3de108e819db" style="font-weight: normal;"><img style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Gkh6SMb1gH37yFOU_QsA4awqG-i0uDMgQFKLcRAhlXFRi1VqevmHgfvhEoQZG11WjDdp-FjDUlqzEdBzHsaRAyzQ9X6KvLQP8zII5UumeRljHVSm8qOQR5riwOPxGnkAsg" alt="" width="624px;" height="487px;" /></strong><br />Searching allows you to find ideas in the system that have information matching specified keywords. This is especially useful for you to find ideas that you already know something about, because you can search by the name of the idea. It is also useful to find ideas that are for a specific Community Partner, or have a specific Contact person.<br /><br />Filtering allows you to filter the current list of ideas to only contain ideas with certain owners or category values. This is especially useful if you do not know the exact idea you are searching for.&nbsp; For example, if you needed to find projects for Computer Science students you would filter down to ideas with their Discipline set to Department of Computer Science.<br /><br />Sorting allows you to sort the current list of ideas by a specific value. This is useful if you want to sort alphabetically, or you want to find out which ideas are the most active.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><br />3.4 My Page</h2>\r\n<p>My Page contains all the ideas related to you in two sections: Ideas you own and Ideas you are tracking. These sections are resembled the same way as shown in the Home page. Any idea that you see in this section will be the ideas that you receive notifications about when they are updated or commented on (explained in <em>Section 3.5 - Notifications</em>).<br /><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9f17b33b-6bed-d954-5a60-b42e5320a0ed" style="font-weight: normal;"><img style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_lpBijbglnjI51gxws2YO_W4enJMwOLg8hbX0Vs_rV_LqSWrdE_BUsVArtylR406aJwbp6DgyoNDqk73txmy5v4NXJF44xwTjmbmbZ5VUStvlzqp6eWONMOS36ixg8vN1w" alt="" width="624px;" height="353px;" /></strong></p>\r\n<h4>Ideas you own</h4>\r\n<p>There 2 different ways that ideas will end up in this section. Whenever you first create an idea, it will be defaulted to you as the owner of the idea unless you specify otherwise. Secondly, if any member CCEL updates an idea&rsquo;s owner to you, the idea will also then be shown in this section.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h4>Ideas you are tracking</h4>\r\n<p>What we mean by tracking an idea is giving you the ability to follow the progress of any idea in the system, even if you are not the owner of it. You will notice that on all ideas is a page icon with is either blue or white. Blue symbolizes an untracked idea, while white is a tracked idea. At anyone point you can click these icons to switch between tracking and untracking.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9f17b33b-6bef-096e-2dae-b57358b24f8d" style="font-weight: normal;"><img style="transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/00LXCivmDg-e0C4GG17QkoekZSkfnNK-qMO54BbNLYki_imhlDDxeXd2C-WzPlP3zZ-aQCjJCvyh5R84nf7ZmTSp5xK3nJys9oJdGomWIHMcmRxs9zJk0vekGZ56whB7kA" alt="" width="480px;" height="233px;" /></strong><strong> Untracked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tracked</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>3.5 Notifications</h2>\r\n<p>There is a bell icon located in the top right of the screen next to the Welcome button. This is where all your notifications will be located. You will receive notifications from ideas that you are either the owner of or that you are tracking, both of which are explained in <em>Section 3.4 - My Page</em>.
